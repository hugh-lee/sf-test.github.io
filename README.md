Convenient Healthcare Options Right At Your Doorstep  

**Understanding The Benefits of Physical Therapy**
--------------------------------------------------

**Physical therapy** is a type of healthcare service that aims to help patients recover from a multitude of injuries, illnesses, or disabilities through the highly intentional use of exercise, manual therapy, and other techniques. There are many different forms and practices of physical therapy. In our company, we specialize in delivering premier results through the use of various techniques and treatment methods, with a focus on performance therapy, sport therapy, post-operative rehab, and mobile therapy.

Here are some potential benefits of physical therapy:

* **Pain relief:** Physical therapy can help reduce pain through the use of various techniques such as manual therapy, physical agents, therapeutic tools, functional training and exercise intervention. By reducing pain, patients may be able to participate more fully in their daily activities and improve their quality of life.
* **Improved mobility:** Physical therapy can help improve mobility and range of motion, which can be especially important for patients recovering from injuries, pain, or surgeries. Improved mobility can also help reduce the risk of falls and other injuries.
* **Improved strength:** Physical therapy can help improve both overall strength and specific strength of muscles. Oftentimes, there are muscle imbalances present unbeknownst to a patient recovering from an injury or setback. Furthermore, patients develop repetive stress injuries after an area of the body has been worn out passed its capacity causing compromise to the local tissue (muscle, tendon, joint). Patients can benefit from intentional strengthening exercises to help overcome weakness necessary to overcome any shortcomings.
* **Improved balance:** Physical therapy can help improve balance, which can be especially important to regulate muscle imbalances, recover from injury, and reduce potential for a new injury.
* **Rehabilitation after surgery:** Physical therapy can be an important part of the recovery process after surgery. Physical therapists can help patients regain strength and mobility and reduce the risk of complications such as blood clots.
* **Management of chronic conditions:** Physical therapy can effectively manage chronic conditions such as arthritis, chronic pain, or chronic injury. By helping patients build strength and mobility, physical therapy can help reduce the symptoms of these conditions and improve quality of life.
* **Sports injury prevention and recovery:** Physical therapy can be especially important in preventing and recovering from sports injuries. Physical therapists can help athletes improve their reactiveness, strength, mobility, power, agility, resilience, endurance and balance, which all play an interdependent role on reducing the risk of injury.
* **Education:** Physical therapists can educate patients on proper body mechanics, posture, and movement patterns to help prevent future injury and reduce the risk of re-injury. PTs also educate patients on how to self-manage and regulate symptoms independently for sustainability.

These are just a few of the **many** potential benefits of physical therapy. If you are experiencing pain or other health issues, consider having a consultation with one of our clinicians to see if physical therapy could be an effective treatment option for you.

Civil Physical Therapy is a wonderful play to both strengthen your own fitness while regaining strength, flexibility, and mobility to a previous injury. I have both began to lose weight, gain overall strength, while doing a variety of fun and interesting exercises. Cliff and his wife both provide a great, positive, and uplifting environment. I always look forward to going and working on improving myself as well as learning something new about my physical health.

Cliff is an extraordinary Physical therapist with professional and personable approach to each client. After many sessions in other PT places Cliff is the first therapist who helped me recover mobility and strength in my hip. He is kind and compassionate but also consistent and firm in making sure you maximize the benefit of the exercises without hurting yourself. He is creative in changing up the routine and is encouraging in every step of the process. I am always looking forward to our sessions as I feel better after it and can clearly see the progress and benefits of our work together. I highly recommend Cliff to anyone in need of professional , knowledgeable and effective physical therapist.

Clifford has been a great force in my chronic pain due to late onset of degenerative scoliosis. There is no fix but through his knowledge, demeanor and attentiveness I am able to get back to doing some of the things I enjoy doing with minimal pain.

I had a meniscus surgery a year ago. And to be honest, for a moment I thought that I was never gonna get back to normal, but one day I found out about Civil Physical Therapy and I decided to give it a try. My life changed completely after that day and I am extremely grateful with Clifford and Maribel. They gave me the warmest welcome and since my first session with Cliff I knew that this was something different. It felt like he could feel what I feel when I'm doing the exercises, he knows how to guide his patients in such a detailed way so that I have the perfect form without hurting but still pushing myself to do more and more. I've been to other physical therapists before, but never found one like CPT so personalized and perfect for what I need and what my body can handle. 10/10!

Amazing experience each session with Dr. Civil. His attention to detail is unmatched. He takes the time to assess the body and provide the correct stretch/workout needed to resolve my issues. In the brief 2 months I've been seeing Dr. Civil, I have seen a significant improvement in my trouble areas. Thanks for everything.

Excellent experience. Dr. Civil is extremely knowledgeable and skilled. From the consultation I knew I was in good hands. I would highly recommend his services for anyone interested in returning to sport, enhancing your performance. They followed up with me the same day of my inquiry into services.

Cliff is the man! I've had chronic shoulder pain and he really took care of me. He was knowledgable, detail-oriented, and really listened to what my goals were. Cliff provided me with a routine that allowed me to continue exercising while also rehabilitating my injury. I'm lucky to have had the opportunity to work with him while he was still in Brooklyn, and now Atlanta, he's all yours! Thanks again
